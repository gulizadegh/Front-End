            <p class="Chevrolet-Information">The 1967 model was redesigned with enhanced Coke bottle styling that featured Corvette-inspired front and rear fender bulges. The curves were the most pronounced with the 1967â€“1968 models. In keeping with federal regulations, safety features were built into Impalas during the 1967 and 1968 model years, including a fully collapsible energy-absorbing steering column, side marker lights, and shoulder belts for closed models. The L72 engine was not available in 1967, but the L36 Turbo-Jet V8 was optional. GM adopted a new lock system for all models, replacing the previous system that had been in use since 1936 with letter-coded keys that changed each year.</p>
